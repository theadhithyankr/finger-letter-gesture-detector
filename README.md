# Hand Gesture Recognition

This project utilizes the [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) library and OpenCV to detect hand gestures in real-time using a webcam.

## Overview

The code in this repository analyzes hand gestures captured through the webcam in real-time. It detects landmarks on the hand and calculates distances between specific landmarks to identify gestures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theadhithyankr/Finger-Letter-Gesture-Detector.git
cd HandGestureRecognition
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python hand_gesture_recognition.py
```

3. Point your hand towards the webcam and make gestures to see real-time recognition.

## Features

- Detects and displays landmarks on the hand.
- Identifies finger positions and calculates distances to recognize gestures.
- Displays the recognized finger and associated letter in real-time.
